Title: Parses a model to create a predict routine with Tidy Eval
Description: The mail goal of 'tidypredict' is to use Tidy Evaluation to produce a formula that 
can be executed inside 'dplyr' verbs that calculates the prediction based on a model. In other words, 
it takes place of the predict() function. The main motivation for tidypredict is to open the 
possibility to score the new results inside a database or Spark.
