\title{Returns a Tidy Eval formula to calculate prediction interval}
\usage{
tidypredict_interval(model, interval = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An R model or a tibble with a parsed model}

\item{interval}{The prediction interval, defaults to 0.95}
}
\description{
It uses parse_model to create a tabular version of the data needed to create
a Tidy Eval formula that can then be used inside a dplyr command.  It uses
S3 methods to automatically determine the class of the model and run the
corresponding function that is able to create the Tidy Eval formula.  It
currently supports lm() models.
}
\details{
The result still has to be added to the fit to obtain the upper bound, and
substracted from fit to obtain the lower bound.

\examples{

df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 5, 6 ,6), y = c(2, 3, 6, 5, 4))
model <- lm(x ~ y, df)
tidypredict_interval(model)
